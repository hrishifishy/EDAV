1 Introduction
==============

### 1.1 Motivation

Grades are primary indicators of a student's academic performance. While there may not be a correlation between grades and a student's intelligence, there are definitely multiple external factors which contribute to a student's grade. We wanted to analyze the effect of multiple factors like parents' education, alcohol consumption, free time, etc. on a student’s grades.

### 1.2 Questions which we are interested in studying

We made several guesses before exploratory data analysis.

As positive factors to grade, we made following guessses.

-   Students’ grades are higher
    -   If study time is longer
    -   If they get support from family or school
    -   If parents took higher education

As negative factors to grade, we made following guessses.

-   Students’ grades are lower
    -   If students consume more alcohol
    -   If students are frequently absent from school

### 1.3 Team Member and Individual Contribution to Project

Our team consists of Hrishikesh Telang, Naoto Minakawa, and Somendra Tripathi. For exploratory data analysis (EDA) part, we categorize variables into several groups as mentioned in detail later at 3.2. Each individual conduct EDA for assigned group of variables. After EDA, Hrishkesh implemented interactive chart in D3/Shiny, Somendra conducted further EDA, Naoto gathered materials to create report. Finally, we reviewed our consolidated work and created executive summary. We regularly discussed issues and progress so that we can be on the same page.
